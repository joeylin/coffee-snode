#About

This is nodejs Blog for Express.js, Node.js and MySQL. 
The view engine is CoffeeKup. In this example code I try to demo a bit of everything: sessions, database, ajax, etc. Hopefully it will help people like myself to start.

#Setup Database

* Edit coffee_server/config.coffee and set the contants with "DB_" prefix
* Import this sql script: db_create.sql

#Run

Open a terminal do: 

```
cake watch
```

Open another terminal do:

```
node app.js
```
